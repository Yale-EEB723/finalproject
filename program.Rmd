Write a program to execute the stuff in Ramos' supplement.  
1. Synteny analysis: identify the genes in the synteny block in animals that have that gene.  
How to define borders of synteny block? Maybe what is shared by Cnidarians + Bilaterian?  
2. BLASTP this list against por/cteno genome. Identify por/cteno orthologues by reciprocal best hit.  
3. Identify the chromosome in which the majority of these genes are found.
4. Test for whether this clustering of genes is significant using exact binomial test. Calculate the probability of a gene being found on scaffold x divided by the total number of annotated genes in all scaffolds.
