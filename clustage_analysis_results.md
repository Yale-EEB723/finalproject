#### ClustAGE Results Analysis

#### Chloramphenicol Resistance
  - Bin555: IDed a chloramphenicol resistance protein in Choleraesuis, SCH_011, and an unknown protein SCH_012
    - SHown also in Schwarzengrund, not characterized there though
    - Shows that you can ID genes related to virulence/ abx resistance
    - Blasting the sequence of SCH_012 with BLASTp
      - Found many other places, but no annotation
      - Closest is DNA topoisomerase, may help with resistance of another antibiotic
    - bin 524 shared in both strains, chloramphenicol resistance gene
      - Bcr/CflA family efflux transporter
      - uniprot search for SeSA_B0064
  - Bin266: SNSL254_pSN254_0040,chloramphenicol resistance in Newport
    - florfenicol/chloramphenicol resistance protein FloR
    - Same as above, Bcr/CflA family efflux transporter
  - ClustAGE paper: "Antibiotic resistance genes are frequently found in the accessory genomes of clinically important bacterial pathogens."
