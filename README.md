## Instructions

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it as a template for your project, and develop your code in the forked repository. After you fork the repository, please enable the issue tracker in the repository settings so that others in the class (including the professor) can provide feedback. To submit the project, send a pull request to the original repository.

Expand on the readme questions below to provide an overview of the goals, background, and challenges for the final project. You can delete the questions as you write text that answers them, or leave the prompts in place. You can also delete this instruction section of you like.

Add all code to your project repository, including shell scripts, R analyses, python, etc.

Do not commit large data files to the repository. Provide paths to where they can be downloaded if they
are from public sources, or track them with [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com).

## Introduction

This is a final project for the [Comparative Genomics](https://github.com/Yale-EEB723/syllabus) seminar in the spring of 2019. 
This project aims to study the evolution of immune and echolocation genes in bats. Further, I will perform a trait analysis to understand the evolution of foraging types and migratory behavior across the bat clade.

## Background

Most human emerging infectious diseases across the world are zoonotic. Especially Viruses ocurring in mammals are of major concern. Examples include Anthrax, Birdflu and Ebola (Anthrax paper XXX, Karesh et al. 2012 The Lancet, Nature Olival et al. 2018). Thus, it is of primary concern to understand the drivers and patterns of viral biodiversity in wild animals (Oliver et al. 2018, 5-6). This is especially relevant for migratory animals as they cross continents and political boundaries (Harisson et al. 2018 Nature Eco Evo, 2018 Science paper zoonosis migration ). 
Understanding patterns of viral diversity in wildlife and determinants of successful cross- species transmission, or spillover, are therefore key goals for pandemic surveillance programs4. However, few analytical tools exist to identify which host species are likely to harbour the next human virus, or which viruses can cross species boundaries5–7. Here we conduct a comprehensive analysis of mammalian host–virus relationships and show that both the total number of viruses that infect a given species and the proportion likely to be zoonotic are predictable. After controlling for
