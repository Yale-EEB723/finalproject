# Final Project

## Introduction

This is a final project for the [Comparative Genomics](https://github.com/Yale-EEB723/syllabus) seminar in the spring of 2019. This project used RNA-seq data published on SRA to test the validity of the group Cyclostomata, the living jawless fishes. 

## The goal

I sought to explore is to analyze

## The data

Paired-end sequences are accessible on SRA for the following lamprey species:

Petromyzontinae: Petromyzon marinus, Ichthyomyzon castaneus, Ichthyomyzon fossor

Lampetrinae: Lampetra planeri, Lethenteron camtschaticum, and Lethenteron reissneri,

Geotriidae: Geotria australis

and the two hagfish species (Eptatretus burgeri and Eptatretus cirrhatus).




## Background

Motivation for the project....

How it fits in with other work...

What the reader needs to know to understand the project


## Methods
I plan to use the Agalma pipelines to infer a preliminary species tree with RAxML.

## Results


## Assessment

Was it successful in achieving the initial goal?

What are the main obstacles encountered?

What would you have done differently?

What are future directions this could go in?
