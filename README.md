## Introduction

This is a final project for the [Comparative Genomics](https://github.com/Yale-EEB723/syllabus) seminar in the spring of 2019. 

This project aims to study the evolution of immune, olfactory and echolocation genes in bats. Further, I will perform a trait analysis to understand the evolution of foraging types and migratory behavior across the bat clade.

## The goal

We assessed the comparative genomics of immune, olfactory and echolocation genes using a total of 8 bat genomes and a completed phylogenetic mammal tree. I performed gene annotation using XXX bat species as reference genome to identify patterns in gene evolution of the above mentioned genes. Another goal was to map foraging mode and migratory behavior across all bat clades using ancient character reconstructions.

## Background

Most human emerging infectious diseases across the world are zoonotic. Especially Viruses ocurring in mammals are of major concern. Examples include Anthrax, Birdflu and Ebola (Anthrax paper XXX, Karesh et al. 2012 The Lancet, Nature Olival et al. 2018). Thus, it is of primary concern to understand the drivers and patterns of viral biodiversity in wild animals (Oliver et al. 2018, 5-6). This is especially relevant for migratory animals as they cross continents and political boundaries (Harisson et al. 2018 Nature Eco Evo, 2018 Science paper zoonosis migration ). Animal migrations across the world are dissapearing (Wilcove, Wikelski 2008) and anthropogenic pressures are reducing animal movement (Tucker 2018) with 
important implication for human well-being.
It is important to understand how vectors of zoonosis have evolved their immune genes for defence against virulence, and key ecomorpholocial traits crucial for their survival. Bats have been identified as the most virulent mammalian group (Olival et al. 2018), are distributed across all continents except for Antartica with over 1000 species (Bat diversity world paper).
In this project, we investigated gene evolution of XLY immune genes and echolocation genes XXX in a group of XYZ bat species. We further mapped the global biodiversity of bats (using IUCN rangemaps) and investited whether bat species richness (and diversification) and environmental conditions are related with diversification rates and mutiple origin of gene evolution in immune genes in bat.
