# Final Project

## Instructions

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it as a template for your project, and develop your code in the forked repository. After you fork the repository, please enable the issue tracker in the repository settings so that others in the class (including the professor) can provide feedback. To submit the project, send a pull request to the original repository.

Expand on the readme questions below to provide an overview of the goals, background, and challenges for the final project. You can delete the questions as you write text that answers them, or leave the prompts in place. You can also delete this instruction section of you like.

Add all code to your project repository, including shell scripts, R analyses, python, etc.

Do not commit large data files to the repository. Provide paths to where they can be downloaded if they
are from public sources, or track them with [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com).

## Introduction

This is a final project for the [Comparative Genomics](https://github.com/Yale-EEB723/syllabus) seminar in the spring of 2019. This project will attempt to identify differences between different Salmonella species and serovars by comparing host-specific and broad host range genomes of Salmonella.

## The goal

Specifically, I will try and find similarities and differences between Salmonella that are host-specific (eg: Salmonella gallinarium [Chickens]/ S. enterica serovar typhi [Humans]), either for pathogenicity islands, other genes, or even structure and evolution of the genomes. The goal is to see if there are any readily identifiable differences in gene content between these pathogens which target either specific hosts or a wide range of hosts. This problem has not been attempted to any great depth in Salmonella, although there have been increased efforts to compare Salmonella genomes in general.
