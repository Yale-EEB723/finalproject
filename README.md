# Final Project

## Introduction

This is a final project for the [Comparative Genomics](https://github.com/Yale-EEB723/syllabus) seminar in the spring of 2019. This project will analyze publicly available RNA-seq data obtained from the SRA database for presence and absence of important immune genes, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, in a clade of teleost fishes known as notothenioids.  

## The goal

The goal of this work is to characterize the presence and diversity of immune-related genes in a clade of teleost fishes known as notothenioids. The notothenioids dominate the biomass, abundance, and diversity of the Antarctic continental shelf and represent a rare example of adaptive radiation in a marine enviornment. Understanding the genomic basis of immunity in notothenioids represents an important, but thus far understudied, axis for understanding the notothenioid adaptive radiation in Antarctica. 

## The data

Previously-sequenced and publicly-available notothenioid transcriptomes will be downloaded from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive. We will obtain transcriptomes for all Antarctic and non-Antartic species represented in the database. 

This project will also require a reference genome. For this, we will use the genome of the Antarctic bullhead notothen (Notothenia coriiceps), which will be obtained from BioProject.

## Methods

Immune-related genes will be identified from the notothenioid transcripts using a combination of BLAST and HMMER searches. We will then infer the hylogenetic relationships of the sequences identified as MHC genes and we will estimate relative rates of evolution for sequences that are highly conserved or diverged between notothenioid species. We will pay special attention to comparisons between genes in Antarctic notothenioids and genes in non-Antarctic notothenioids to determine genes that may be unique to Anatarctic notothenioids.
