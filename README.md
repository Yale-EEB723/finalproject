# DJM Final Project

## Instructions

This repository is a stub for your final project. Fork it as a template for your project, and develop your code in the forked repository. After you fork the repository, please enable the issue tracker in the repository settings so that others in the class (including the professor) can provide feedback. To submit the project, send a pull request to the original repository.

Expand on the readme questions below to provide an overview of the goals, background, and challenges for the final project. You can delete the questions as you write text that answers them, or leave the prompts in place. You can also delete this instruction section of you like.

Add all code to your project repository, including shell scripts, R analyses, python, etc.

Do not commit large data files to the repository. Provide paths to where they can be downloaded if they
are from public sources, or track them with [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com).

## Introduction

This is a final project for the [Comparative Genomics](https://github.com/Yale-EEB723/syllabus) seminar in the spring of 2019. 
My project is to sequence and assemble the first darter genome using an Oxford Nanopore platform to collect long-read sequence data. 

## The goal

<<<<<<< HEAD
The long-term goals are to provide genomic resources for many future darter projects, including phylogenomic inference, functional genomics studies, and reference mapping. I will sequence a genome for *Etheostoma perlongum*, a species restricted to single lake in NC. The "sister species" of *E. perlongum* is *Etheostoma maculaticeps*, which can be found in the Waccamaw River that drains the lake. My specific goals are to use the genome to help assemble a large amount of ddRAD data that I have collected along a transect spanning the lake and the river. Our preliminary de novo assemblies and analyses of the ddRAD data indicate a steep cline between the lake and river, with some loci exhibiting particularly sharp breaks. My secondary goal is to map these outlier loci to the genomes to identify candidate regions that are maintaining the species boundary between the lake and river.

## The data

I have not collected the data yet, but plan to use an Oxford Nanopore PromethION platform to sequence one darter species to ~30x coverage.

## Methods

I plan to perform the DNA extraction and sequencing in mid-March in the lab of Trevor Krabbenhoft, a collaborator at the University of Buffalo (http://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/biological-sciences/faculty/faculty-directory/trevor-krabbenhoft.html). I will use a variety of base-calling and assembly methods, including Scrappie and Canu (outlined in Jain et al. 2018). I will hopefully perform genome annotation using several additional sources of data, including exon-capture sequences and transcriptomic data from a closely related darter species.
