# Go to NCBI Protein:
[1] Type in TLR7 Myotis
[2] Download them all together as .FASTA
[3] Finding a outgroup to the TLR gen:
The tree is rooted by the outgroup TIR domain of Homo sapiens TLR5
outgroup TIR domain Homo sapiens interleukin 1 receptor
interleukin 1 Homo sapiens from the paper # Phylogeny of Toll-Like Receptor Signaling: Adapting the Innate Response Plos One
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein
In NCBI Protein type in "interleukin 1 Homo sapiens"
Mistake! We need the receptor not just the interleukin 1 -> This is probably just the signaling molecule
In NCBI Protein type in  "Interleukin-1 Receptor Homo sapiens"
[4] Blast the downloaded sequenes against the entire NCBI databases ->
To confirm the predicted and low quality TLR protein sequences
BlastP

[5] Now we can try to align our sequences on TLR 7 using mafft
# We Download MAFFT on https://anaconda.org/bioconda/mafft
# I pasted all my sequences TLR gene and outgroup into a signle new fasta file that I will be aligning with MAST.
# MAFFT is a multiple sequence alignment program for unix-like operating systems. It offers a range of multiple alignment methods.
For this we have to put the ingroup (TLR genes) and the outgroup .fasta sequences into a single file.

[6] Lets run mafft
Now we have aligned our TLR genes with the outgroup TIR gene of humans! Yayyyy
mafft --auto ingroup_w_outgroup.fasta > aligned_ingroup_w_outgroup.fasta
# Input output
When we align things not every thing aligns, could be due to low quality sequences and this  affects my phylogeny when I make it
# phylogeny needs a degree im similarity in order to move.
[7] Now we try to install gBlock for trimming
conda install -c bioconda gblocks
INDIR=/Users/diegoellis/projects/development/Comparative_genomics/finalproject/Data/TLR_7/
gblocks and trimmomatic are failing; lets try trimAL
trimal -in aligned_ingroup_w_outgroup.fasta -out trimmed_al_in_outgroup.fasta  -htmlout trimmed_al_in_outgroup.html -gt 1
# will remove all columns with any gap (equivalent to -nogaps option)


[8] Now that we have aligned and trimmed our sequences its time to build our gene tree
# Lets try Iqtree
conda install -c bioconda iqtree
# Say bioconda is super useful instead of going to github pages or such to download
iqtree -nt AUTO -s trimmed_al_in_outgroup.fasta # Makes the outgroup # trimmed_al_in_outgroup.fasta.treefile

[9] The tree is in Newack format; i have to download figtree for this:
 iqtree -nt AUTO -b 100 -s trimmed_al_in_outgroup.fasta  # Make a tree with 100 bootstrap.
# For command line visualizaiton:
conda install -c bioconda ete3
ete3 view --text MyTreeFile.nw

[10] Ape? Try this out.
ete3 view --text MyTreeFile.nw
Load a tree and link it to the alignment:
from ete3 import PhyloTree
# http://etetoolkit.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial_phylogeny.html
# Make a pipeline for everything else.
was there diversification of TLR between bats or did it arose efore that?
# Get the protein name and accesion number -> Show in my presentation for all my TLR genes.
