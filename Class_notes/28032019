# Phylogenetic course:

Maximum likelihood estimation:

Note and edges!

Node any point collected by a branch. Nodes are allmost allways implicit.

Bi-partition: Split tips into 2 groups. -> Split -> A division that occurs along the edge.
1:1 relation between split and edges.

Often many trees zB bootstrap sample.

Make a list of all the splits you see in all the trees -> Count how often splits are found.

Newick format: Text string to represent a tree.
Things that are sisters to each other are placed with a coma and in a parentesis.

AND rule: multiply probability
OR rule: Add probabilities
Combining AND and OR:
Whats the probability of all of these things hapenning in combination.
Independence: Dices are independent.

Likelihood:
Surprise = what happens and what our expectation was what would have happened.
Expectation = our model.
Our implicit model was that these are fair dice.

Likelihood: The probability of the data given the model. How probable was the result we got, given our model understanding of the system
the likelihood of all mdoels for a particular set of data are NOT expected to sum to one. These likelihood are super small normally.

Maximum likelihood: Whats the probability of the data under all different models -> The model explaining the highest likelihood is the max likelihood.
Actual probability of any specific outcome aproaches zero with increasing number.

Relationships are depicted by the edges. -> Likelihood of what we see at A given what the ancestral sequence was. Now this is
conditional likelihood.

Check the legend to tell you what the edge length is. -> edge length could mean anything
phylogram: Expected number of substitutions per site

Maximum likelihood estimation of a phylogenetic trees:

# Transition probability:
Likelihood: Probability
Max likelihood: The hypothesis with the highest likelihood given the data of the model.
Likelihood for any given hypothesis is allways gonna be very small. ->
Likelihood function is NOT a probability distribution function -> Does not encessarily sum up to 1.

For likeliood: We need data, a model of evolution, a hypothesis and a mechanism to calculate the likelihood given the above.

MU: gas pedal how fast the matrix is operating. Mean instantenaous rate.
Relative rate: Tuning term; difference in rate from going to one state to another state.
Assumptiion: Tme is reversible.

# Sequence:

How certain are you that your model is correct? Im absolutely certain that this is wrong! -> There is no way that these are the actual estiamtes!
For what I want to know -> Are the vlaues close enough to the actual values to obtain a reasonable estimate of what i wanna predict.
all models are wrong but some models are useful
How much variation in the data can the model explain? -> This tells me whether I have a very inaequate model -> I have parameters that do a poor job in fitting my model to the data.


Character evolution:
DNA is a discrete trait.

MK model: Assumes all the relative rates are the same.
Sturdyng the morphology of the genome. Which orders are genes in, where do the introns go -> Quesitons on spatial organization
-> Where is this limb, what colour is the limb in that spot?

Cuz phylogenetics methods came out of systematics which came out of museum work which came out of morphology ->
Analyze morphologica data is more advanced than methods sued to study evolution of genome morphology = comaprative genomics
Genomics is new and fancy and tehcnologically crazy and descriptive morphology is measuring stuff with a caliper.
Comparative genomics: scott roy san francisco state
Intron gain and loss:
Continious trait models:
DNA and protein sequence evolution drove discrete trait models forward.


Brownian walk: Is a independent proces! Markov process -> Only thing that is determining the next step is where I was on the current step. Nothing where I was before matters.
The distribution is approximating a normal distributuon.
