Casey Dunn Class 14.02.2019:

Assembly stuff:

Assembly: No biological inference -> We start with an animal with long contiguous chromosomes ->
 Sample prep -> Chromosomes get broken down -> Then chopped into tiny sequences. -> Then assembly.



Annotator: Take reads and puzzle them together
⎝	Assembly: Identify and fix errors.


Challenges in extention now: We puzzle reads together -> Assembly graphs ->
 complicated branching and merging structure.

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
There is not ONE human genome that tells us all about human variation ->
Lie. If we reconcile sequences of every human in the room -> Every place where there is a diference
between us will lead to problems.
Differences between haplotypes is major challenges -> Try individual sequencing
Heterozygozity is a problem.

Bats and Whales or rare species -> collect wing clips AND release the bats -> do tissue culture
grow up and then sequence those cells. -> Reduces number of haplotypes in population to sequence
single individuals.

How much is due to error, Heterozygozity,
Instead of comming up with 23 chromosome sequences -> Assemble 46 chromosomes (diploud organisms)
0> Depends on our actual goal: ->


I need read lengths that are long enough.

Take assembly graph -> Alts is a bag you call Alts ->
Then take assembly through these paths ->
Genome assembly -> Building assembly has gotten good.
# Contigs and scaffold: Definition:

# Do I have too many repeats, maybe i have polyploidy -> What is causing
shattering of the assembly?

# Learn Atoms


Really long reads => Frequent order misscalls ->
How do we fix those error? (pacbio)

Short reads: High quality (illumina)

Map illumina to pacbio data and correct the errors with the reads.


Ab initio: ML purely computaitonal. Neural Nets. Here is a sequence, i know there isa  gene there and not a gene there. RUn 100000 times once I have trained it. Hard to know, need big enouh training dataset.
Evidence bases: Have new assembly and have MRNA, i know which regions are being transcriped
Reference based: Compare to most closely related platinum related genome or blast agains all of ref-seq. Downaod all known genes and look which are present in my genome of interest.
I sequence new genome of an organism cuz there is something different thats not the same as drosophila or mouse -> collect sq data and assembly and basically ask "Which mouse genes are here or which drosophila genes are there" -> Wont find the biochemical and unique gene pathways that make this nonmodel organisms unique.
This perpetuates that we cant find the unique stuff in our non-model organism.This method is bad at findng things that are NOT present in model organism.
For all denovo genome assembly -> Do all 3. Some have false positives , gives me idea how confident i sould be with annotation.

Good to take all reads and concatenate to N:
Key parameters:
Correctness
Contiguity: How long are genome products.  -> Length distance, N50 summarizes length.
Completeness: What fraction of actual genome is covered.
zB BUSCO manially cureated sets of genes (present in allmost all animals) -> how many busco genes are in my sequence
Correctness:
Need to balance these 3 parameters.

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Genome: Collection of single gene annotations.
Can manage sensitivity and get really high.
Sepcificity: How often is gene annotaiton that im finding actually a gene (might be contaimnate, pseudogene)

e-value of blast is a parameter of sensitivity, specificity (to blast all genes).

All annotations in genomes have an error!
ENCODE: overimplies funcitonal annotation of stuff
All that glitters is not gold.

All should be quesiton based: -> How compelte does my genome need to be,
whats good contiguityu?
Dony think of goal as maxiimuzing the 3C -> thingk about what i wanna answer ith that genome?
Only criteria all 3C must answer: Does this answer my research question of interest?




Transcript: Hey tell me where your genes are (on an organism) getting cheapter
RNA seq and other methods that are good to understand genome function and relevant to annotation.

Yale-EEB723 is an organization. Has set of repos.
A repository: Syllabus, excersize is one, final project, course docker.

finalproject Repo: Fork it ->
# Git repo is folder of documents with version control
# Save snapshots called commits.
# Backup files, track all changes, easy for sharing. Work with someone on a word document.
# The unit is the repo.
# Readme: When someone goes to github, thats whats treated as the landing page -> describe intent of the work.
# the sylabus is the readme zB.
# Fork vs clone ->Clone (local copy of a repo that exists somewhere else)
# fork is compeltely dif repo that is templated from the original repo.

# Clone my repo: github in cloud now has my final copy of my project
clone create local copy of the forked final project -> Work on changes locally and then commit locally.



git clone https://github.com/diego-ellis-soto/finalproject
# Change something
git status # git stil hasnt done anything about it
git commit -am "first change during class" # Im gonna type a commit message
git push
