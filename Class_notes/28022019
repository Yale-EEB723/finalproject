Genomic technologies: Genome is 3D dynamic structure, has a shape in time and space.
Progress understanding genome shape at multiple lvl (not just syntony, order) but also what parts of chromosome are next to other parts.

Predecessors of RNA-seq: Know your genome before hand -> put probes of genome on wells ->
microArray: often identify dieseases -> compare normal condition with cancer -> Isolate RNA -> generate cDNA -> Look at sequence ends -> get your reads -> Map to genome -> identify the transcriptome and other downstream analysis.
RNA seq: What genes are being experssed and map it to the genome -> Trapnell et al. 2012 Nature Protocols. -> Need reference genome.
When you dont have an annotated genome -> sequence transcriptome with long reads -> Assemble transcriptome and use that as reference genome where you map your RNA back.- >You dont use tophat for that, you use straight bowtie

You have reads, map them with tophat, assemble and merge with cuffmerge, then get a transcriptome and then ....XXXX

Add adapters to CDNA: and add adapters and directionality. Happens debofre amplification process. So you ligate to adapters and then amplify using PCR.
