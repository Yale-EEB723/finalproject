Genomic technologies: Genome is 3D dynamic structure, has a shape in time and space.
Progress understanding genome shape at multiple lvl (not just syntony, order) but also what parts of chromosome are next to other parts.

Predecessors of RNA-seq: Know your genome before hand -> put probes of genome on wells ->
microArray: often identify dieseases -> compare normal condition with cancer -> Isolate RNA -> generate cDNA -> Look at sequence ends -> get your reads -> Map to genome -> identify the transcriptome and other downstream analysis.
RNA seq: What genes are being experssed and map it to the genome -> Trapnell et al. 2012 Nature Protocols. -> Need reference genome.
When you dont have an annotated genome -> sequence transcriptome with long reads -> Assemble transcriptome and use that as reference genome where you map your RNA back.- >You dont use tophat for that, you use straight bowtie

You have reads, map them with tophat, assemble and merge with cuffmerge, then get a transcriptome and then ....XXXX
RNA often first normalized: Control for different sequencing effort in different sequence samples.
RNA normalization, statistical analysis of ratio of expression between those libraries, we dont look at abolsute expression, its neither expression lvl of diferent genes, its expresion lvl of diferent genes at diferent samples.


RNAseq: big interest in expression -> assess between diferent treatments cancers -> what are different genes doing.
Is RNA telling you the absolute abundance of molecules in a cell? -> NO.
Is gene A more active than  gene B? -> Count the transcripts.

Gene A Count 1000 basepair 1500
Gene B Count 2000 basepair 4500

Library prep bias and amplification: Many library prep protocol biased towards certain sequences
Sequencing effort is also important
e
Count = f(n, length of transcript, S, Effort, e)
# RNA seq is not expression its transcript abundance!!! ->
Function = series of knobs that are in serie (is that gene present YES/NO) ->
is it in genome -> gene gain/loss is 1 level of activity.

Gene gain/loss
chromatin access
transcribed
transcript deg
translational rate
prot degreed
prot modification # kinase activity on sets of genes and how it changes the activity of genes -> protein abundance -> i dont know what fraction of protein is active.
# the abundance of mRNA doesnt tell you exactly about function
-> Activity

# Question: I have genbank accession number: How do I align the reference genome?
# How do I download NCBI data based on alignments?
# Email Ben Evans and ask. For conceptual advise.

Add adapters to CDNA: and add adapters and directionality. Happens debofre amplification process. So you ligate to adapters and then amplify using PCR.
