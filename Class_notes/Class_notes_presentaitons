# Computational genomics: Finding Ghost loci
Gene loss
Sponghe has nervous system
Ctenophore has nervous system
Establish loss -> Do a synteny analysis and look for gene loss
Cnidaria genome: 2 sponghe genomes

# Sampling of animals:
# Iqtree

# Distribution of scaffold length -> Most genomes/assemblies are pretty fragmented
# Identify homologous genes -> find homologs with Agalma
# Does all vs all blast.


# generate ML Tree in IQTree -> Fix the topology using ML Tree and estimate divergence time chronograms in BEAST
# Use FastML infer ancestral states given tree topology and branches







# Nate
# Nate ask a phylogeny for all the animals of Myotis and the outgroup!


# SUMAC -g not really working or recognizing the FASTA file that I gave it.
# IQtree reading on it.
# Cant install Uclust !


# BUSCO on HPC -> Look at busco scores and assembly length.
# Assembly length not related to busco completeness


# FASTA file of guide sequences not found. Please re-try.
TLR 3 and 9 failed. TLR 7.
MAKER gives us GFF files tells us genomic features and places in genome -> takes 5 day -> Use this info for ab initio gene prediciton software.
