# The most high quality genome is Myotis lucifugus
# Thus, I plan on using the ingroup Myotis for my analyiss.
# Using the phylogenetic mammal tree of Nate Upham (in prep.) and a phylogenomic paper published in https://www.nature.com/articles/srep27726 .
# Thus, I use Murina as a outgroup for my analysis. 
# I further looked at the NCBI taxonomy browser.
