1. id syntenic blocks in genome
-is synteny preserved across these genomes?
-are the genomes contiguous and correct enough to identify this?
2. id blocks with missing genes

-focus on programs that id synteny and try to identify syntenic blocks
-id syntenic blocks
	-need at least 3 genes 
-do gene inventories on syntenic blocks


--{}---{}---{} A
--{}--------{}- B
-need at least 3 loci including GOI otherwise contig may just be short
-how many times are these minimal criteria present?

gff3 best but gff interconvertable

exercise on how to work with gff files
make histogram no genes/contig per species - from gff = within species distribution (so if no contigs > 3 genes is answer)
-id homologous genes across genomes - if annotation is same as cell type import cell type results or import gene models as proteins and do agalma
-then can build on top of gff3
