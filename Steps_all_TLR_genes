# Go to NCBI Protein:
[1] Type in TLR7,TLR5,TLR3,TLR8,TLR9 Myotis
Type in NCBI Protein: Toll-like receptor Chiroptera
Type in NCBI Protein: interleukin 1 receptor Homo sapiens. This will serve as the outgroup
Download them all together as .FASTA

# For alignment we have to put the ingroup (TLR genes) and the outgroup .fasta sequences into a single file.

To confirm the predicted and low quality TLR protein sequences
BlastP
I did this for TLR 3,4,5,7

# [D] Alignment with mafft
# --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---


# We Download MAFFT on https://anaconda.org/bioconda/mafft
echo 'Align our TLR genes with the outgroup TIR gene of humans'
mafft --auto ingr_outgr_TLR.fasta > aligned_ingr_outgr_all_TLR.fasta # input output order
# During alignment, not everything actually gets aligned.
Could be due to low quality sequences and this affects further analysis (i.e. phlyogenetics)

# Ask Casey and Ian about gap score
# will remove all columns with gaps in more than 20% of the sequences or with a similarity score lower than 0.001,
# unless this removes more than 40% of the columns in the original alignment,
# we want to conserve at least 60% of them.
# In such cases trimAl v1.2 will add the necessary number of columns (in decreasing order of scores)
# so that the minimum coverage is respected.

# Now that we have aligned and trimmed our sequences its time to build our gene tree
# echo 'Lets try IQtree' | conda install -c bioconda iqtree

# [G] Visualizing the gene tree
# --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

# All PhyloTree instances are, by default, attached to such layout for tree visualization, thus allowing for in-place alignment visualization and evolutionary events labeling.
[9] The tree is in Newack format; I converted the TREE using ape::write.tree.
# This takes a few hours
# ete3 annotated -t tree.nw --ncbi
cd /Users/diegoellis/projects/development/Comparative_genomics/finalproject/Data/All_TLR/
ete3 view -t trimed_inout_TLR_tree_newick.nw
# http://etetoolkit.org/documentation/tools/
 iqtree -nt AUTO -b 100 -s trimmed_al_in_outgroup.fasta  # Make a tree with 100 bootstrap.
# For command line visualizaiton:
conda install -c bioconda ete3
ete3 view --text MyTreeFile.nw

[10] Ape? Try this out.
ete3 view --text MyTreeFile.nw
Load a tree and link it to the alignment:
from ete3 import PhyloTree
# http://etetoolkit.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial_phylogeny.html
# Make a pipeline for everything else.
was there diversification of TLR between bats or did it arose efore that?
# Get the protein name and accesion number -> Show in my presentation for all my TLR genes.
#

# Next I could try to align all the sequences i got from SUMAC?!

# Visualize the gene tree of the subset only 4 TLR genes and their alignment:
# ete annotate: annotate tree nodes with external data or using NCBI taxonomy information.
