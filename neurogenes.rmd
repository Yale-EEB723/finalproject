#Paper notes
###Moroz et al., 2014  [@Moroz2014]
-Table 34S:
-structure of figure shows that it is from bilaterian perspective (closer to bilateria more rectangles filled in)  
-remember there are also random absences in cnidaria; the mirror of bilateria, but all the proteins are characterized from bilateria  
-no examples where ctenophores or sponges don't have something present in fungi, capsaspora, monosiga  
-Suppl Table 12as - it's possible didn't use Amphimedon genome, but Amphimedon was covered by the other papers and I crossreferenced them.  

Mentioned in text:  
Not in ctenophores:   
neurogenin  
NeuroD  
Achaete-scute  
REST  
HOX  
Otx  

-not that much overlap in genes looked at by Riesgo vs Moroz  

###Ryan et al., 2013  [@Ryan2013]
*netrin, slit, unc-5 (axon guidance) not in Mnemiopsis or Amphimedon*  
-used genomes, since based on Alie and Manuel 2010  
Supplementary Table S17: Presence and absence of post-synaptic genes  - pretty much Alie and Manuel 2010
Supplementary Table S19: Presence and absence of Dopamine / Norepinephrine /Epinephrine Biosynthetic Pathway components   

-are seqs of the animals in S17 genomes? Unsure, but all animals in table have genomes (and the Mle seqs are from the genome)  
-AMPA iGluR and NMDA iGluR included as iGluR  

###Alie and Manuel, 2010  [@Alie2010]
-used genomes  
-Ryan built on Fig. 1. Cross ref with current data to make sure have everything.  
-Only use Monosiga, Trichoplax, Amphimedon, Nematostella, Hydra, Homo  
  Capitella (3 absences), Drosophila (2 absences), Homo very similar with few differences  
  Unicellular animals mostly missing everything (except B-cat and PMCA). Start with Monosiga which has more things.
B-cat and PMCA are ancient - interesting?  
AMPAR and NMDAR collapsed into iGluR in table; presence of one of these trumped absence of the other  
PKC alpha-beta-gamma = PKC on table  

#[Table](https://github.com/jasminelmah/compgen/blob/master/neurogenes_table.numbers)  
_Table abbreviations_  
DBH - dopamine-B-hydroxylase  
DDC - DOPA decarboxylase  
TH - tyrosine hydroxylase  
TPH - tryptophan hydroxylase  
PAH - phenylalanine hydroxylase  
GAD - glutamate decarboxylase  
Qdpr -  quinoid dihydropteridine reductase,  
Slc18A2 = Homo sapiens solute carrier family 18 member 2,  
Pnmt = phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase  

Missing domains  
Piccolo - Pleurobrachia - missing ZF (Moroz et al., 2014)  
Erbin - Pleurobrachia - missing PDZ (Moroz et al., 2014)  

Species names written to the broadest level - eg. Monosiga brevicollis in Riesgo et al but only Monosiga in Moroz, so put Monosiga only  

Many entries have NA but if combine:  
Salpingoeca + Monosiga = Choanoflagellida  
Pleurobrachia + Mnemiopsis = Ctenophora  
Amphimedon + Oscarella = Porifera  
Nematostella + Hydra = Cnidaria  
Get only 4 entries that have an NA.  
*(What about 0/1s (conflicting info?)*  >> decided to transform 0/1s into NA

Loss_Status:
P1C0: present in Porifera, absent in Ctenphora - 6 instances  
C1P0: present in Ctenophora, absent in Porifera - 3 instances  
T0: absent in Trichoplax but present in Ctenophora or Porifera - 5 instances  

There is only 2 instances where Capsaspora has a 1 while choanoflagellates have 0: GABAR and DDC. Don't use column in second iteration  
'Fungi' is very vaguely defined - don't use column in second iteration  
Stopped at Delta catenin

Make new table where all 0/1s or missing_domains (i.e. not 0,1,NA) into NA  

Create a new table where species for Ctenophora, Porifera combined: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14563531/combine-column-to-remove-nas

-most synteny programs designed with assumption working on complete high quality genomes.  
-need N50 of at least 1Mb for robust synteny analysis  
-Fig. 5 - Below 0.5 Mb error rate skyrockets - looks like close to 20-30% for ~100-200 kbs N50s
-This can represent a major source of systemic bias in my analysis   
**Look up N50s of your genomes.**

2. Should we be expecting these genes in these animals?  
Why should they use similar genes?  
How misguided is this approach? What is the true question implied by this approach?
